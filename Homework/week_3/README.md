# Homework week 3
This week, I made a website which visualizes the NBA Finals Series between 1980 and 2017.
On the site's homepage, all information on how to navigate on the site can be found.
In case the site does not work properly on a computer different than mine, I have a backup here: https://tobiasmaatita.github.io/DataProcessing/Homework/week_3/java_assignment/nba.html.

This backup contains the graph with all the data.
This html can also be found in the folder Homework/week_3/java_assignment/, with the file being nba.html

The convertCSV2JSON.py file can be found in the folder Homework/week_3/. This program writes to documents in the folder Homework/week_3/data.
