          <p>For this assignment, I plotted a line graph containing data from the NBA
            Finals between 1980 and 2017. I incorporated two types of information: first,
            the mean number of points scored in the Finals by both the champions and
            the runners up. Second, the percentage of threepointers scored by both the
            champions and the runners up. I hoped to show that scoring threepointers has
            become a more important aspect of basketball over the years. Indeed, a small
            increase of the percentage of threepointers can be detected while the average
            number of scored points stays level. However, from this data one should not
            infer that threepointers are more common today. <br><br>
            Navigate via the buttons in the navigation bar. To see the average number of
            points scored by the champions and runners up, choose 'Points'. 'Threes' shows
            the percentage of scored threepointers. 'Both' renders a linegraph of both the
            points and threepointers, to compare the different trends.<br><br>
            A link to the data used for these graphs can be found under the 'Data source' button.
