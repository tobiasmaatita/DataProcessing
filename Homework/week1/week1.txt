What is a so called “branch” in Git terms and why would you use it?
> A branch is a moveable pointer to one of your commits. The master branch points to the latest commit, 
  > and one can create other branches to point to other commits. One could use branches to easily turn
  > back to older versions of their work, or to create diverging history. Also, branches facilitate
  > merging two diverged commits.
